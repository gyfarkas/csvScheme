  \section{Introduction}
The goal is to build a domain specific language for large scale data
manipulation, that helps reasoning about the behaviour of data,
specificly the data operations as implemented in spark. This is
different from simple embedded DSLs that would target to make reading
and writing data manipulations easier. However still do not aim for
the strongest and broadest possible language, instead it is targeting
to find a strong enough language that can exclude ill-behaving
prodrams, that would cost too much, but still be relatively cheap to
implement and use. That I think exlude highly complicated fully
dependent typed languages (idris) and probably all too general
programming languages (haskell or scala) that might be capable to
achieve it with all bells and whistles they have as a type system and
extension, but not being specific to the problem makes solutions
unnecessarily complicated.

The work introduces two independently well studied typing concepts and
tries to make them work interconnected.
\begin{itemize}
  \item row types, and extensible records
  \item linear types, and resoure tracking in types
  \end{itemize}
